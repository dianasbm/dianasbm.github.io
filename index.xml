  Media Coverage  This is a note for Harvard PhD students who would like me to advise their reseach. Importantly, none of the following is set in stone. Different types of advising relationships work best for different students. If you would like me to be your advisor, come talk to me, and we can discuss what would work best for you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis, Department of Economics. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Lemann Fellow, a Faculty Affiliate at the Center for Effective Global Action CEGA and an Invited Researcher for JPAL .
My current research focus is in the field of Development Economics, in particular, its intersection with Public, Political and Organizational Economics. As a researcher, Iâ€™m interested in two topics, poor governance in governments and social mobility, both of which I study in the developing country context.</description>
