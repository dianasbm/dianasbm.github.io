<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Claudio Ferraz and Frederico Finan)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Public Economics, October 2012</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: This paper examines if money matters in education by looking at whether missing resources due to corruption affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of Brazil&#39;s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Emanuel Ornelas)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>EconomiA, Aug 2008</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: The World Trade Organization (WTO) monitors trade among 151 countries, which are responsible for over 96% of the world&#39;s aggregate trade flows. Through its Dispute Resolution System, the WTO arbitrates disputes among its members with respect to possible violations of the institutions&#39; rules and of agreements established previously under its auspieces. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this mechansim from Brazil&#39;s perspective. The paper discusses the main aspects of the workings of the Dispute Resolution System and analyzes Brazil&#39;s performance in the WTO dispute since its inception, in 1995. We find that Brazil achieved success in the majority of the disputed in which it participated. This suggests that the reduction in the number of disputes in which the country participated since 2002 may have been caused by a reduction in violations by its trading partners.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Jonas Hjort, Gautam Rao, and Juan Santini)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Conditionally Accepted, American Economic Review</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: Can research findings change political leaders’ beliefs and cause policy change? Collaborating with the National Confederation of Municipalities in Brazil, we work with 2,150 municipalities and their mayors. We use experiments to measure mayors’ demand for research information and their response to learning research findings. In one experiment, we find that mayors and other municipal officials are personally willing to pay to learn the results of impact evaluations, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger-sample studies more, while not distinguishing on average between studies conducted in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy (reminder letters for taxpayers) increases the probability that their municipality implements the policy by 10 percentage points. In sum, we provide direct evidence that policy-makers value research information, change their beliefs when presented with it, and that this can drive policy change. Information frictions may thus help explain failures to adopt effective policies.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Mitra Akhtari and Laura Trucco)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Resubmitted, American Economic Review</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: We study how political turnover in mayoral elections in Brazil affects public service provision by local governments. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office experience upheavals in the municipal bureaucracy: new personnel are appointed across multiple service sectors, and at both managerial and non-managerial levels. In education, the increase in the replacement rate of personnel in schools controlled by the municipal government is accompanied by test scores that are .05-.08 standard deviations lower. In contrast, turnover of the mayor’s party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Previously circulated as: Recognizing Performance</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: Does the recognition of someone’s accomplishment spill over to others? Awards that confer public recognition for outstanding performance can impact ex-post behavior by changing beliefs, norms or interests. I investigate whether the public recognition of students’ accomplishments impacts their own and their peers’ subsequent academic performance. I exploit Brazil’s Math Olympiad &#34;Honorable Mention&#34; award which recognizes the top 4% of participants in a national competition involving 18 million students annually. I take advantage of the fact that no information is disclosed on the performance of those who do not win an award to recover the informational impact of someone’s recognition. Specifically, I use a regression discontinuity design comparing classrooms with narrow winners and losers of the award. I find that the award improves the future educational outcomes of both the winner and her classmates. The spillovers on classmates are economically meaningful - one-fifth of the magnitude of the effects on the winner themselves - and have long-run consequences: the enrollment in selective colleges of classmates of a narrow award winner increases by 10%. Proximity to the winner, both physical and in terms of ability, appears to be a key mediating channel: spillovers are largest for classmates in the top quartile of the test score distribution, and depend upon the presence of the winner in the classroom. The results show that ex-post motivation and effort can be enhanced by recognizing the performance of a high-achieving student.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Santiago Pérez)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Full draft coming soon</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(5)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_5" style="display:none;">: How do civil service reforms affect the personnel outcomes and performance of government organizations? We study the consequences of the 1883 Pendleton Act on the functioning of the US customhouses. The act required customhouses with 50 or more employees to recruit workers through competitive exams, but exempted the smaller ones. We collect personnel records and information on receipts and expenses to compare the functioning of exempted and nonexempted customhouses, before and after the reform. Employees in reformed customhouses stayed longer in their jobs and had stronger professional backgrounds. However, these improvements did not translate into greater cost-effectiveness at collecting revenue. We explore the interplay between the reformed mid-tier bureaucrats and the non-reformed tiers of the bureaucracy as a potential explanation of why revenue per dollar spent did not increase with the reform.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Who Benefits from Meritocracy?</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Santiago Pérez)</p>




<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(6)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_6"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_6" style="display:none;">: We use historical archive records from the personnel assignments of  US federal government from 1871-1891 and its link to the individuals and their parents in earlier US Census to answer two questions. First, does meritocratic reforms help or harm social mobility? In particular we hope to understand how merit reforms affected representation of minorities and low-ses groups in the government bureaucracy. Second, we document the evolution of the organizational structure - growth of layers, source of high-rank appointees, pay gradient and etc - of the US government overtime when transitioning from a patronage system-to-meritocratic system. To answer both questions we use a DiD strategy using the civil servant reform that changed the appointment system for certain units/positions in the US government and we leverage the information on personnel assignments to understand composition and evolution of working groups/units.
