<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Politicians and Tax Policy: The Role of Preferences and Beliefs</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Inés Badin, Monica Singhal and Juan Francisco Santini)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>National Tax Journal, forthcoming</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: We examine the role of politician preferences and beliefs about tax policy drawing on a unique survey of over 700 local government leaders (mayors) in Brazil. Mayors rate raising tax revenue as an important policy priority and express strong beliefs that a range of tax interventions have the potential to improve revenue collection. Mayors are generally confident in their beliefs and often appear overoptimistic relative to existing empirical evidence. Mayoral political preferences as well as beliefs about the effectiveness of tax interventions are predictive of mayors seeking out further knowledge by attending an information session on raising tax revenue.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Santiago Pérez)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em> American Economic Journal: Applied Economics Vol. 16(3): 250–291, July 2024</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: Competitive exams are a standard method for selecting civil servants. Yet, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness. We digitize personnel and financial data to study the impacts of the 1883 Pendleton Act, which mandated exams for some employees in the largest US customs-collection districts. Although the act improved targeted employees’ professional background and reduced turnover, it did not increase cost-effectiveness in customs revenue collection. Moreover, it incentivized hiring in exam-exempted positions, distorting districts’ hierarchical structures. These results illustrate how, by triggering countervailing organizational responses, policies that succeed at improving specific organizational aspects might nevertheless fail to improve overall performance.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Mitra Akhtari and Laura Trucco)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>American Economic Review, Vol. 112, no. 2: 442–93, February 2022</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: We study how political turnover in mayoral elections in Brazil affects public service provision by local governments. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office experience upheavals in the municipal bureaucracy: new personnel are appointed across multiple service sectors, and at both managerial and non-managerial levels. In education, the increase in the replacement rate of personnel in schools controlled by the municipal government is accompanied by test scores that are .05-.08 standard deviations lower. In contrast, turnover of the mayor’s party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

We use experiments with 2,150 Brazilian municipalities to measure mayors’ demand for and response to research information. In one experiment, we find that mayors are willing to pay to learn the results of evaluation studies, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger sample studies more, while not distinguishing between studies in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy, taxpayer reminder letters, increases the probability the policy is implemented by 10 percentage points.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Claudio Ferraz and Frederico Finan)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Public Economics, October 2012</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(5)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_5" style="display:none;">: This paper examines if money matters in education by looking at whether missing resources due to corruption affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of Brazil&#39;s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Emanuel Ornelas)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>EconomiA, Aug 2008</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(6)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_6"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_6" style="display:none;">: The World Trade Organization (WTO) monitors trade among 151 countries, which are responsible for over 96% of the world&#39;s aggregate trade flows. Through its Dispute Resolution System, the WTO arbitrates disputes among its members with respect to possible violations of the institutions&#39; rules and of agreements established previously under its auspieces. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this mechansim from Brazil&#39;s perspective. The paper discusses the main aspects of the workings of the Dispute Resolution System and analyzes Brazil&#39;s performance in the WTO dispute since its inception, in 1995. We find that Brazil achieved success in the majority of the disputed in which it participated. This suggests that the reduction in the number of disputes in which the country participated since 2002 may have been caused by a reduction in violations by its trading partners.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Santiago Pérez)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>submitted</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(7)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_7"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_7" style="display:none;">: By making “merit” the main hiring criteria, civil service exams have been described as promoting social mobility and opening doors for the “talented poor”. However, their critics argue that they perpetuate existing inequalities rather than leveling the playing field. We assess whether exams help or hurt the chances of lower-SES individuals by using evidence from the Pendleton Act, a landmark reform in American history which introduced competitive exams to select certain  federal employees. Using newly assembled data on the socioeconomic backgrounds of federal employees, we find that, although the reform increased the representation of “educated outsiders” (individuals with high education but limited connections), it reduced the representation of lower-SES individuals. This reduction was stronger among applicants from states with high educational inequality. These findings suggest that, if one worries about the trade-off between equity and efficiency, exams might not lead to improvements on both margins as has often been argued.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Previously circulated as: Recognizing Performance</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(8)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_8"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_8" style="display:none;">: Does the recognition of someone’s accomplishment spill over to others? Awards that confer public recognition for outstanding performance can impact ex-post behavior by changing beliefs, norms or interests. I investigate whether the public recognition of students’ accomplishments impacts their own and their peers’ subsequent academic performance. I exploit Brazil’s Math Olympiad &#34;Honorable Mention&#34; award which recognizes the top 4% of participants in a national competition involving 18 million students annually. I take advantage of the fact that no information is disclosed on the performance of those who do not win an award to recover the informational impact of someone’s recognition. Specifically, I use a regression discontinuity design comparing classrooms with narrow winners and losers of the award. I find that the award improves the future educational outcomes of both the winner and her classmates. The spillovers on classmates are economically meaningful - one-fifth of the magnitude of the effects on the winner themselves - and have long-run consequences: the enrollment in selective colleges of classmates of a narrow award winner increases by 10%. Proximity to the winner, both physical and in terms of ability, appears to be a key mediating channel: spillovers are largest for classmates in the top quartile of the test score distribution, and depend upon the presence of the winner in the classroom. The results show that ex-post motivation and effort can be enhanced by recognizing the performance of a high-achieving student.
