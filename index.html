<p>I&rsquo;m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://economics.ucdavis.edu/directory-of-people/econ-faculty#c4=all&amp;b_start=0">University of California, Davis, Department of Economics</a>. I&rsquo;m also a <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/lemann-fellowship/">Lemann Fellow</a> and a Faculty Affiliate at the Center for Effective Global Action <a href="https://cega.berkeley.edu/our-people/">CEGA</a>.</p>

<p>My current research focus is in the field of Development Economics, in particular, its intersection with Public, Political and Organizational Economics. As a researcher, I’m interested in understanding what makes an effective government in the developing country context. Within government frictions are pervasive in such settings, shaping what policies are adopted, how well or poorly they are implemented. To date, I have studied such frictions restraining the operation of government programs and organizations in Brazil.</p>

<p>I earned a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard University. In the past, I worked in the World Bank at Washington DC supporting countries in the Latin America and Caribbean Region and countries in the South Asia Region.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Claudio Ferraz and Frederico Finan)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Public Economics, October 2012</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: This paper examines if money matters in education by looking at whether missing resources due to corruption affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of Brazil&#39;s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Emanuel Ornelas)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>EconomiA, Aug 2008</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: The World Trade Organization (WTO) monitors trade among 151 countries, which are responsible for over 96% of the world&#39;s aggregate trade flows. Through its Dispute Resolution System, the WTO arbitrates disputes among its members with respect to possible violations of the institutions&#39; rules and of agreements established previously under its auspieces. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this mechansim from Brazil&#39;s perspective. The paper discusses the main aspects of the workings of the Dispute Resolution System and analyzes Brazil&#39;s performance in the WTO dispute since its inception, in 1995. We find that Brazil achieved success in the majority of the disputed in which it participated. This suggests that the reduction in the number of disputes in which the country participated since 2002 may have been caused by a reduction in violations by its trading partners.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Mitra Akhtari and Laura Trucco)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, American Economic Review</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: We study how political turnover in mayoral elections in Brazil affects public education provision. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office subsequently have test scores that are .05–.08 standard deviations lower. Party turnover leads to a sharp increase in the replacement rate of headmasters and teachers in schools controlled by the municipality. In contrast, turnover of the mayor’s party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/dm/Moreira_JMP.pdf" target="blank">Recognizing Performance: How Awards Affect Winners and Peers Performance in Brazil</a></h3>



<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Previously circulated as Success Spills Over</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: Does the recognition of someone’s accomplishment spill over to others? Awards that confer public recognition for outstanding performance can impact ex-post behavior by changing beliefs, norms or interests. I investigate whether the public recognition of students’ accomplishments impacts their own and their peers’ subsequent academic performance. I exploit Brazil’s Math Olympiad &#34;Honorable Mention&#34; award which recognizes the top 4% of participants in a national competition involving 18 million students annually. I take advantage of the fact that no information is disclosed on the performance of those who do not win an award to recover the informational impact of someone’s recognition. Specifically, I use a regression discontinuity design comparing classrooms with narrow winners and losers of the award. I find that the award improves the future educational outcomes of both the winner and her classmates. The spillovers on classmates are economically meaningful - one-fifth of the magnitude of the effects on the winner themselves - and have long-run consequences: the enrollment in selective colleges of classmates of a narrow award winner increases by 10%. Proximity to the winner, both physical and in terms of ability, appears to be a key mediating channel: spillovers are largest for classmates in the top quartile of the test score distribution, and depend upon the presence of the winner in the classroom. The results show that ex-post motivation and effort can be enhanced by recognizing the performance of a high-achieving student.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Do Research Findings Influence Policy? Experimental Evidence from 2,145 Brazilian Municipalities</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Jonas Hjort, Gautam Rao, and Juan Santini)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Funding from JPAL GI exploratory grant, Lemann Brazil Research Fund, Weiss Family Program Fund for Research in Development Economics</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: This paper investigates if research findings cause political leaders to enact policy change. To do so we use new types of experiments to measure elected heads of governments’ (i) demand for research and (ii) policy responses to supply of research. Collaborating with the National Confederation of Brazilian Municipalities gave us access to a sample of 2,145 municipalities and the agents—mayors—who control their policies. In one experiment, we find that mayors are willing to pay to learn the results of impact evaluations; update their posterior over the expected impact of a policy in their own municipality in the “correct” direction if informed of research findings; and pay more for types of studies that subsequently affect their beliefs more. They value larger-sample studies more, while not distinguishing on average between studies in rich or poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that providing mayors with research findings indicating positive, cost-effective impact of a simple policy (reminder-letters for tax enforcement) increases the probability that mayors implement the policy in their own municipality by 10 percentage points. In sum, this paper’s results provide the first direct evidence that political leaders who (know that they) have access to academic research translate research findings into policy change. Our estimates suggest that, when research has limited impact on policy practice, information frictions can be an important part of the explanation.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(8)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_8"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_8" style="display:none;">: The quality of a teacher is not only difficult to assess but also bears little relationship with her earnings. We investigate the effect of market wide disclosure of teacher’s quality in Brazil. We exploit a natural experiments that publicly disclosed a measure of teachers’ quality for a group of teachers, and study the consequences for the teachers’ career path. Leveraging employer-employee matched data from Brazil, we also hope to document whether the disclosure impacts the relationship between earnings and teacher’s quality, and how the response varies depending on the presence of different type of schools – private and public – in the market.
