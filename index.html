<p>I&rsquo;m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://economics.ucdavis.edu/directory-of-people/econ-faculty#c4=all&amp;b_start=0">University of California, Davis, Department of Economics</a>. I&rsquo;m also a Faculty Affiliate at Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development <a href="https://www.ibread.org/about/people/">BREAD</a> and at the Center for Effective Global Action <a href="https://cega.berkeley.edu/our-people/">CEGA</a>, an Invited Researcher for <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac">JPAL</a> and <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/">Weiss Family Fund</a>, and a <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/lemann-fellowship/">Lemann Fellow</a>,  and  .</p>
<p>My current research focus is in the field of <strong>Development Economics</strong>, in particular, its intersection with <strong>Public, Political and Organizational Economics</strong>. As a researcher, I’m interested in two topics, poor governance in governments and social mobility, both of which I study in the developing economies context. You can find <strong><a href="https://dianamoreira.com/pdf/dm/statement_dm.pdf">here</a></strong> a short research statement. My research has been published in the American Economic Review, in the Journal of Public Economics and has been featured in leading Brazilian media outlets.</p>
<p>I earned a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard University. In the past, I worked in the World Bank at Washington DC supporting countries in the Latin America and Caribbean Region and countries in the South Asia Region.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Mitra Akhtari and Laura Trucco)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>American Economic Review, Forthcoming</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: We study how political turnover in mayoral elections in Brazil affects public service provision by local governments. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office experience upheavals in the municipal bureaucracy: new personnel are appointed across multiple service sectors, and at both managerial and non-managerial levels. In education, the increase in the replacement rate of personnel in schools controlled by the municipal government is accompanied by test scores that are .05-.08 standard deviations lower. In contrast, turnover of the mayor’s party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Jonas Hjort, Gautam Rao, and Juan Santini)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>American Economic Review, Vol.111, No. 5, May 2021</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: Can research findings change political leaders’ beliefs and policies? We use experiments with 2,150 Brazilian municipalities to measure mayors’ demand for and response to research information. In one experiment, we find that mayors are willing to pay to learn the results of evaluation studies, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger sample studies more, while not distinguishing between studies in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy, taxpayer reminder letters, increases the probability the policy is implemented by 10 percentage points.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Claudio Ferraz and Frederico Finan)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Public Economics, October 2012</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: This paper examines if money matters in education by looking at whether missing resources due to corruption affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of Brazil&#39;s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Emanuel Ornelas)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>EconomiA, Aug 2008</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: The World Trade Organization (WTO) monitors trade among 151 countries, which are responsible for over 96% of the world&#39;s aggregate trade flows. Through its Dispute Resolution System, the WTO arbitrates disputes among its members with respect to possible violations of the institutions&#39; rules and of agreements established previously under its auspieces. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this mechansim from Brazil&#39;s perspective. The paper discusses the main aspects of the workings of the Dispute Resolution System and analyzes Brazil&#39;s performance in the WTO dispute since its inception, in 1995. We find that Brazil achieved success in the majority of the disputed in which it participated. This suggests that the reduction in the number of disputes in which the country participated since 2002 may have been caused by a reduction in violations by its trading partners.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Santiago Pérez)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>submitted</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: Competitive exams are a standard method for selecting civil servants. Yet, evidence on the effectiveness of such approach is mixed, and lack of personnel data limits our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this varying success. We digitize personnel and financial data to study the impacts of the 1883 Pendleton Act, which mandated exams for some employees in the largest US customs-collection districts. The reform improved targeted employees’ professional background and reduced turnover. However, it did not increase cost-effectiveness in revenue collection. An unintended consequence of the reform was to induce hiring in exempted positions, provoking distortions in districts’ personnel structure. Our results illustrate the importance of considering the incentives of all involved parties when designing reforms.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Previously circulated as: Recognizing Performance</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(5)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_5" style="display:none;">: Does the recognition of someone’s accomplishment spill over to others? Awards that confer public recognition for outstanding performance can impact ex-post behavior by changing beliefs, norms or interests. I investigate whether the public recognition of students’ accomplishments impacts their own and their peers’ subsequent academic performance. I exploit Brazil’s Math Olympiad &#34;Honorable Mention&#34; award which recognizes the top 4% of participants in a national competition involving 18 million students annually. I take advantage of the fact that no information is disclosed on the performance of those who do not win an award to recover the informational impact of someone’s recognition. Specifically, I use a regression discontinuity design comparing classrooms with narrow winners and losers of the award. I find that the award improves the future educational outcomes of both the winner and her classmates. The spillovers on classmates are economically meaningful - one-fifth of the magnitude of the effects on the winner themselves - and have long-run consequences: the enrollment in selective colleges of classmates of a narrow award winner increases by 10%. Proximity to the winner, both physical and in terms of ability, appears to be a key mediating channel: spillovers are largest for classmates in the top quartile of the test score distribution, and depend upon the presence of the winner in the classroom. The results show that ex-post motivation and effort can be enhanced by recognizing the performance of a high-achieving student.
