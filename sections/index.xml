      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis, Department of Economics. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Lemann Fellow and a Faculty Affiliate at the Center for Effective Global Action CEGA.
My current research focus is in the field of Development Economics, in particular, its intersection with Public, Political and Organizational Economics. As a researcher, I’m interested in understanding what makes an effective government in the developing country context. Within government frictions are pervasive in such settings, shaping what policies are adopted, how well or poorly they are implemented.</description>
