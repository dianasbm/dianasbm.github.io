      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis, Department of Economics. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Lemann Fellow, a Faculty Affiliate at the Center for Effective Global Action CEGA and an Invited Researcher for JPAL .
My current research focus is in the field of Development Economics, in particular, its intersection with Public, Political and Organizational Economics. As a researcher, Iâ€™m interested in two topics, poor governance in governments and social mobility, both of which I study in the developing country context.</description>
